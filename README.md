approach for solution of task:

We can tag specific id for space in any regular/polygan shaped site based on their properties length,breadth,area..etc)
based on that we can place suitable chairs and utilize maximum space



User Guidence:

Note:I have included libraries for angular js,bootstrap,jquery,fontawesome from online sources.Please make sure that your machine is connected to internet or not
(bootstrap,angular,jquery minification files,font awesome css files will load if machicne is connected to internet)

whenever html file runs in browser,Blueprint with space id's will comes along with form

In form user can give his inputs(name,space id) to place chair in required spaces

If user give any different space id not in blueprint then chair won't be placed

User can not place chair with same space id's(to avoid duplicates)

User can delete chair from spaces in blueprint

User can check previous floor plan by click on previous button 

When User click on enterence gates (direction icons) It will directs to spaces in the block

If user reloads page then it reset all variables values to intial values
